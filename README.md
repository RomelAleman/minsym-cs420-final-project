# MinSym

A programming language desinged to be near pain english

## Why?

I initially chose my final project to be a challenge on how expressive I can make a language without the use of symbols, but after writing some examples, I realized symbols were neccassary to make the program readable, so I decided that rather than challenging my self to make a language with no symbols, I would create a language that is alost plain english, then try to make this program as expressive as possible. I wanted to make a program that can be a tool for learning programming and a tool for fairly complex tasks.

## Before Quick Start

You must have both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [TextX](https://textx.github.io/textX/index.html) installed and configured to your environment

## Quick Start

If you haven't already, download the file from the webpage: [MinSym](https://romelaleman.github.io/minsym/)

Unzip the file to any location you want

Open the file and run the file 'run.bat', if everything is configured correctly, this should print out "Hello, World!" to the console

In the file, 'testing.minsym' will be the location of your code (feel free to use any textx editor), you can add and change the names of the minsym file, just remember to update the name in the minsym.py file
